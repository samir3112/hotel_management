# kubernetes env

## To bring machine up
   carry on all instuctions on gitbash

   ensure Vagrant is setup

   ```
   git clone this repository
   cd kubernetes-env
   vagrant up
   ```
## To work with VSC
   on gitbash -> code.

   this will open VSC

   install the "Remote - SSH" extension on VSC

   on git bash type -

   vagrant ssh-config

   store the content of controlplane host only on some file like kube-vm-config.txt (change name of host to Docker)

   on VSC - ctrl + shift + P

   Remote-SSH: Open SSH Configuration File -> Settings -> add the previous created file

   again on VSC - ctrl + shift + P - > Remote SSH: Connect to Host

   connect to controlplane (host) and select Linux on pop-up

   VSC will be downloaded on vagrant machine (with till download finish)

## Import Docker-Kubernetes git repo now to work with
   ```
   git clone https://<git_user>:<git_password>@github.com/cbagade/py-docker-kubernetes-learnings.git
   on VSC - Explorer - Open /home/vagrant/py-docker-kubernetes-learnings/
   select linux platform when prompted
   Trust the author when prompted
   open app.py -> VSC might prompt to install python extension, install
   open Dockerfile -> VSC might prompt to install docker extension, install
   ```

## Ensure Kubernetes Setup
   ```
   open terminal
   kubectl get nodes
   ```   

## How to work
   building and pushing of docker images should be done from Docker host (vm)

   kubernetes related stuff should be done from controlplane host (vm)

## Setup Prerequisites

- A working Vagrant setup using Vagrant + VirtualBox

## Documentation

Current k8s version for CKA, CKAD, and CKS exam: 1.29. 

The setup is updated with 1.29 cluster version.

Refer to this link for documentation full: https://devopscube.com/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant/


## Prerequisites

1. Working Vagrant setup
2. 8 Gig + RAM workstation as the Vms use 3 vCPUS and 4+ GB RAM

## For MAC/Linux Users

The latest version of Virtualbox for Mac/Linux can cause issues.

Create/edit the /etc/vbox/networks.conf file and add the following to avoid any network-related issues.
<pre>* 0.0.0.0/0 ::/0</pre>

or run below commands

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /etc/vbox/
echo "* 0.0.0.0/0 ::/0" | sudo tee -a /etc/vbox/networks.conf
```

So that the host only networks can be in any range, not just 192.168.56.0/21 as described here:
https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/vagrant-2-2-18-osx-11-6-cannot-create-private-network/30984/23

## Bring Up the Cluster

To provision the cluster, execute the following commands.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/scriptcamp/vagrant-kubeadm-kubernetes.git
cd vagrant-kubeadm-kubernetes
vagrant up
```
## Set Kubeconfig file variable

```shell
cd vagrant-kubeadm-kubernetes
cd configs
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/config
```

or you can copy the config file to .kube directory.

```shell
cp config ~/.kube/
```

## Install Kubernetes Dashboard

The dashboard is automatically installed by default, but it can be skipped by commenting out the dashboard version in _settings.yaml_ before running `vagrant up`.

If you skip the dashboard installation, you can deploy it later by enabling it in _settings.yaml_ and running the following:
```shell
vagrant ssh -c "/vagrant/scripts/dashboard.sh" controlplane
```

## Kubernetes Dashboard Access

To get the login token, copy it from _config/token_ or run the following command:
```shell
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get secret/admin-user -o go-template="{{.data.token | base64decode}}"
```

Make the dashboard accessible:
```shell
kubectl proxy
```

Open the site in your browser:
```shell
http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/#/login
```

## To shutdown the cluster,

```shell
vagrant halt
```

## To restart the cluster,

```shell
vagrant up
```

## To destroy the cluster,

```shell
vagrant destroy -f
```
